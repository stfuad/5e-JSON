While frightened in this way, a creature is incapacitated, can't understand what others say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish; the GM controls the creature's movement, which is erratic. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Maddening Feast for the next 24 hours."

It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it. The target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw.

A creature that doesn't need to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw.
